## Minesweeper game in C++
![Mine sweeper](screenshot.png?raw=true)

This project was developed as an assignment for my C++ programming course in college. You can download the game under releases page.

### Trouble shooting

If the game is garbled, you need to set code page to 950 (Chinese BIG5) by using following command in command prompt:
```
chcp 950
```

Then you need to manually execute the program from that command prompt window.

You can also use `play.bat`, which is included in the release archive.

### Build the project

The game was developed in Visual C++ 6.0, however it should be able to be built under all Visual C++ versions after 6.0.
